Description
---
This repository provides some basic analysis of the issues of the [Ruby on Rail](https://github.com/rails) repository: [rails/rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/). The repository tries to answer the following questions: 
- How do the number of issues evolve over time?
- Are there any periods in which we get more issues?
- Is there anyone who reports more issues than others?
- What is the most popular category (label)?
- Performing basic modeling (pre-trained from Huggingface) to predict the labels for the issues using their description.
